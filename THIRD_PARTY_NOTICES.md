# Third-Party Notices

Original AI Chat Exporter code is covered by [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md). That license does not replace the licenses of third-party software or assets.

## Bundled npm packages

| Package | Version | License | Packaged license files |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pdf-lib` | 1.17.1 | MIT | `licenses/pdf-lib-LICENSE.md` |
| `@pdf-lib/fontkit` | 1.1.1 | MIT, with embedded third-party components | `licenses/fontkit-NOTICES.md` (this document) |
| `pdfjs-dist` | 5.4.624 | Apache-2.0 | `licenses/pdfjs-dist-LICENSE`, `licenses/pdfjs-dist-NOTICE.txt` |
| `@pdf-lib/standard-fonts` | 1.0.0 | MIT | `licenses/pdf-lib-standard-fonts-LICENSE.md` |
| `@pdf-lib/upng` | 1.0.1 | MIT | `licenses/pdf-lib-upng-LICENSE` |
| `pako` | 1.0.11 | MIT and Zlib | `licenses/pako-LICENSE`, `licenses/pako-zlib-NOTICE.txt` |
| `tslib` | 1.14.1 | 0BSD | `licenses/tslib-LICENSE.txt`, `licenses/tslib-CopyrightNotice.txt` |

The build copies complete installed license texts into `dist/licenses/`, together with PDF.js and zlib source notices and the embedded Fontkit notices below. `dist/licenses/manifest.json` records installed versions and associated files. No network access is needed to build these notices. Node-only optional packages and development tools are not shipped in the browser bundles.

## Bundled fonts

`static/assets/NotoSansSC.ttf` is distributed under the SIL Open Font License 1.1. Its complete license remains at `assets/NotoSansSC-LICENSE.txt` in the extension package.

`static/assets/Inter-Regular.ttf` and `static/assets/Inter-Bold.ttf` are unmodified static fonts from the [official Inter 4.1 release](https://github.com/rsms/inter/releases/tag/v4.1), copyright (c) 2016 The Inter Project Authors. They are distributed under the SIL Open Font License 1.1, packaged in full at `assets/Inter-LICENSE.txt`. Inter provides the PDF's system-like sans-serif appearance; it is not Apple's San Francisco font. PDFs containing characters unsupported by Inter or the code font retain the complete Noto Sans SC font for the whole conversation, including Latin text in mixed-script conversations. All font assets are loaded locally from the extension package.

## Fontkit embedded components

The published `@pdf-lib/fontkit` 1.1.1 browser file already bundles font parsing, Unicode, decompression, and browser compatibility code. Its npm distribution omits a standalone Fontkit license file and does not record separate installed versions for these embedded helpers. The following texts preserve upstream helper notices from their published packages and Fontkit source. Helper versions identify the license source archives; they are not a claim that each prebundled module exposes its own version at runtime.

Sources: [Fontkit package and build configuration](https://github.com/Hopding/fontkit), [Fontkit upstream helper lockfile](https://github.com/Hopding/fontkit/blob/master/yarn.lock).

### Declared MIT components without a standalone license file

Published package metadata declares MIT for `@pdf-lib/fontkit`, `@pdf-lib/brotli`, `@pdf-lib/restructure`, `dfa`, and `rollup-plugin-node-globals`. Published authors are Andrew Dillon and Devon Govett (Fontkit), Andrew Dillon (the pdf-lib forks), Devon Govett (dfa), and Calvin Metcalf (the globals shim). The full MIT permission and warranty terms apply to those declarations:

   Lookup table to map the previous two bytes to a context id.

   There are four different context modeling modes defined here:
     CONTEXT_LSB6: context id is the least significant 6 bits of the last byte,
     CONTEXT_MSB6: context id is the most significant 6 bits of the last byte,
     CONTEXT_UTF8: second-order context model tuned for UTF8-encoded text,
     CONTEXT_SIGNED: second-order context model tuned for signed integers.

   The context id for the UTF8 context model is calculated as follows. If p1
   and p2 are the previous two bytes, we calcualte the context as

     context = kContextLookup[p1] | kContextLookup[p2 + 256].

   If the previous two bytes are ASCII characters (i.e. < 128), this will be
   equivalent to

     context = 4 * context1(p1) + context2(p2),

   where context1 is based on the previous byte in the following way:

     0  : non-ASCII control
     1  : \t, \n, \r
     2  : space
     3  : other punctuation
     4  : " '
     5  : %
     6  : ( < [ {
     7  : ) > ] }
     8  : , ; :
     9  : .
     10 : =
     11 : number
     12 : upper-case vowel
     13 : upper-case consonant
     14 : lower-case vowel
     15 : lower-case consonant

   and context2 is based on the second last byte:

     0 : control, space
     1 : punctuation
     2 : upper-case letter, number
     3 : lower-case letter

   If the last byte is ASCII, and the second last byte is not (in a valid UTF8
   stream it will be a continuation byte, value between 128 and 191), the
   context is the same as if the second last byte was an ASCII control or space.

   If the last byte is a UTF8 lead byte (value >= 192), then the next byte will
   be a continuation byte and the context id is 2 or 3 depending on the LSB of
   the last byte and to a lesser extent on the second last byte if it is ASCII.

   If the last byte is a UTF8 continuation byte, the second last byte can be:
     - continuation byte: the next byte is probably ASCII or lead byte (assuming
       4-byte UTF8 characters are rare) and the context id is 0 or 1.
     - lead byte (192 - 207): next byte is ASCII or lead byte, context is 0 or 1
     - lead byte (208 - 255): next byte is continuation byte, context is 2 or 3

   The possible value combinations of the previous two bytes, the range of
   context ids and the type of the next byte is summarized in the table below:

   |--------\-----------------------------------------------------------------|
   |         \                         Last byte                              |
   | Second   \---------------------------------------------------------------|
   | last byte \    ASCII            |   cont. byte        |   lead byte      |
   |            \   (0-127)          |   (128-191)         |   (192-)         |
   |=============|===================|=====================|==================|
   |  ASCII      | next: ASCII/lead  |  not valid          |  next: cont.     |
   |  (0-127)    | context: 4 - 63   |                     |  context: 2 - 3  |
   |-------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|
   |  cont. byte | next: ASCII/lead  |  next: ASCII/lead   |  next: cont.     |
   |  (128-191)  | context: 4 - 63   |  context: 0 - 1     |  context: 2 - 3  |
   |-------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|
   |  lead byte  | not valid         |  next: ASCII/lead   |  not valid       |
   |  (192-207)  |                   |  context: 0 - 1     |                  |
   |-------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|
   |  lead byte  | not valid         |  next: cont.        |  not valid       |
   |  (208-)     |                   |  context: 2 - 3     |                  |
   |-------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|

   The context id for the signed context mode is calculated as:

     context = (kContextLookup[512 + p1] << 3) | kContextLookup[512 + p2].

   For any context modeling modes, the context ids can be calculated by |-ing
   together two lookups from one table using context model dependent offsets:

     context = kContextLookup[offset1 + p1] | kContextLookup[offset2 + p2].

   where offset1 and offset2 are dependent on the context mode.
